Quick Print Check
Hi,

Later on we will have more in depth tests that will involve you downloading a .ipynb notebook file and answering the questions in it. For now, let's have a quick check in to make sure everything is working so far. This should be a very simple problem for you.

Your Task:

Use what you know about the print() function to print out the phrase "Hello World" . Make sure your capitalization and spacing match.
"""

print('Hello World')
