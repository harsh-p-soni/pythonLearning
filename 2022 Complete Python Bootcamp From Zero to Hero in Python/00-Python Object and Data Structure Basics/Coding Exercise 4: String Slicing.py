"""
String Slicing
Use string slicing to grab the word 'ink'  from inside 'tinker'

For example, 'education'[3:6]  returns 'cat'

Remember that when slicing you only go up to but not including the end index.

You should only write one line of code for this. Do not assign a variable name to the string.
