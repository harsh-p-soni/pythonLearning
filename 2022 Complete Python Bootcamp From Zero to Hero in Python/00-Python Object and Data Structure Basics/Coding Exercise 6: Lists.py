"""
Lists
Create a list that contains at least one string, one integer and one float.

For example:

[1, 'two', 3.14159]

Note that the order and number of items doesn't matter.

The answer should just be one list on a single line. Don't assign a variable name to the list.

my_list = ['1', 'two', 3.14159, 2]
